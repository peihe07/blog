Taiwan born / Taiwan raised / Taiwan based

Hi, I’m Pei! I graduated with a degree in Chemistry and have spent nearly 8 years working in chemical R&D. Somewhere along the way, I stumbled into the world of programming — and it was love at first bug fix.

Over the past year, I’ve been diving deep into code during my free time, fascinated by the satisfaction of solving problems, building things from scratch, and discovering tools that make development smoother (and more fun).

Now, whether it’s tinkering with backend APIs, playing with frontend frameworks, or deploying projects just to see them live — I’m probably doing it with a cup of coffee and a big smile.

From beakers to bugs — turns out, I just really love experimenting.

Thank you for visiting!
